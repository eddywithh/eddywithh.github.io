- Q: 
What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
- A: 
The most challenging part of this assignment for me must be the navbar. 
Not very for me easy to work with HTML and CSS.
About 15 hours.

- Q: 
What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
- A: 
I desined a standard pattern(jk, it's just the same color pattern) to make my web more readable and let people know that this is a website for same person. In addition, I uesd grid to make he projects part with frindly-space. And people can easily reach out to the projects.

- Q:
What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
- A:
I struggled in the navbar in the first time and I had no idea like how to design a user-frindly navbar. Actually I have created navbar before but with Bootstrap and JavaScript, which were not allowed in this assignment. So I watched a vedio on YouTube and followed that youtuber to build my own navbar. And then I changed some code in order to meet the requirement for this assignment. At last, my navbar is beautifui and user-friendly.

- Q:
Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
- A:
I would modify the project part with more beautiful font and I would create link to all my projrcts. And also I wanna make space in the projects part more reasonable. I think it is not very good now.

- Q:
How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
- A:
15 hours. And the part that I spend most time is navbar.

If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here.  
I used navbar and contact code from google and youtube because I think they were amazing. But I modified the code to meet the requirement
